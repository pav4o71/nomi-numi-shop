# Nomi Numi Shop

Custom ecommerce platform for a multi-category gifting and merchandise
store.

## Current phase

Phase 1D — Isolated Local PostgreSQL Infrastructure

Phase 0 through Phase 1C are complete. The repository now also includes
isolated local PostgreSQL environments for development and testing via
Docker Compose, guarded lifecycle helpers, and ignored local credentials
under `var/docker/`.

The Next.js application still has no database client, schema, migrations,
or `DATABASE_URL` wiring. Drizzle ORM arrives in Phase 1E. Authentication,
catalog, cart, checkout, payments, shipping, admin, and production
infrastructure remain later phases.

## Initial business scope

Initial markets:

- Philippines
- United States

Initial currencies:

- PHP
- USD

Initial language:

- English

Expected initial scale:

- approximately 500 orders per month

## Planned technology stack

- Next.js 16 App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui
- PostgreSQL 16
- Drizzle ORM
- Better Auth
- Zod
- pnpm
- Docker Compose
- Mailpit
- Vitest
- Playwright

Architecture style:

- modular monolith

Exact application dependency versions are pinned in package.json and
pnpm-lock.yaml.

## Development principles

- one canonical repository
- stable main branch
- narrowly scoped feature/fix branches
- small validated implementation steps
- isolated development and test environments
- server-authoritative commerce logic
- explicit money and currency handling
- no cross-project mutation
- mock payment and shipping integrations first
- production selected only after a separate infrastructure audit

## Authoritative project documentation

Before implementation, read the documents relevant to the current task:

- AGENTS.md
- docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- docs/COMMERCE_RULES.md
- docs/DATABASE.md
- docs/SECURITY.md
- docs/TESTING.md
- docs/ENVIRONMENTS.md
- docs/PROTECTED_RESOURCES.md

## Local PostgreSQL (Phase 1D)

Development:

- Compose project: `nomi-numi-shop-dev`
- Host: `127.0.0.1:55432`
- Database: `nomi_numi_shop_dev`

Test:

- Compose project: `nomi-numi-shop-test`
- Host: `127.0.0.1:55433`
- Database: `nomi_numi_shop_test`

Commands:

    pnpm db:dev:up
    pnpm db:dev:status
    pnpm db:dev:stop
    pnpm db:test:up
    pnpm db:test:status
    pnpm db:test:stop

Local credentials are generated once under ignored `var/docker/` and must
never be committed. Stopping containers preserves environment-specific
named volumes. Host port `5433` belongs to another project and must not
be used. Unknown Docker resources remain protected.

## Preflight

On approved `feature/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`, or `docs/*` development
branches, run from the canonical repository root:

    ./scripts/preflight.sh phase1

On synchronized stable `main`, after refreshing remotes:

    git fetch --prune origin
    ./scripts/preflight.sh integration

Historical Phase 0 preflight modes remain documented in:

`docs/ENVIRONMENTS.md`

A failed preflight is evidence to investigate.

Do not modify or bypass a safety guard merely to make it pass.

## Production

Production infrastructure and the public domain are currently undecided.

A later dedicated phase will inspect the available Hetzner
infrastructure before any production deployment decision is made.
